In the repository is the original data file with all raw data named "field_survey_data". This was then divided into smaller datasets by me to make the coding more simple. These are the remainder of the excel files within the repository. You will also find a DMP document and my annotated code called "shannon index".

This follows the FAIR principles as it is:

FINDABLE on GitHub on my profile and with the correct link.
ACCESSIBLE for other users to download and manipulate.
INTEROPARABLE as people can comment on the information which I have provided and make changes if they wish, or suggest improvements.
REUSABLE as all the data follows the exact same format. If you collect data and stick to this format, then the data is easily interpretable and reusable.
